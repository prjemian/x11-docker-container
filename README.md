# Demonstration of X11 Apps in docker containers

`x11-docker-container`

Show how to run an X11 application (`xeyes`) from a docker container.

- debian
- centos

Could not do this with a [`redhat/ubi8`](https://hub.docker.com/r/redhat/ubi8)
image since a subscription is required to access the `xorg-x11-apps` repository.
